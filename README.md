# Explore-Weather-Trends

In this project, I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.
